# OH-reply

Code and data require to reproduce the analysis from the response to Janz et al.'s reply to Hamm and Fordyce 2015

The original code and data from the Janz et al. response are located in the "evolution data" folder. The original code has not been altered in any way. 
The data are provdied by Janz et al. in the form of an R Data object, thus lines of code that import data (e.g. read.nexus, read.table, and read.csv) do not actually link to data files. 

We would also encourage the reader to provide informative column names for the variables in the data file.
