# Response to the Oscillation Hypothese reply (Janz et al.) by Chris Hamm and Jim Fordyce.

Code and data require to reproduce the analysis from the response to Janz et al.'s reply to Hamm and Fordyce 2015. In addtion, all of the code necessary to reproduce the results and figure of the response to the reply are incuded.

The original code and data from the Janz et al. response are located in the "evolution data" folder. Their original code has not been altered in any way. 
The data are provdied by Janz et al. in the form of an R Data object, thus lines of code that import data (e.g. read.nexus, read.table, and read.csv) do not actually link to data files.
